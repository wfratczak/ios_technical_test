# Samsao's Reporter

Your mission, if you accept it, is to list all public repositories of the
Samsao's organization on GitHub.

For this task, your objective is to create a screen containing, in a list
form, all the Samsao's public repositories on GitHub. Each row must display
the repository full name and last update time.

Each row must be clickable, and once clicked, it must display a small
dialog containing the following information:

 * Language
 * Default branch
 * Forks count

The dialog must have only an "OK" button that dismisses the dialog.

## Guidelines

Write the code to be production-grade. You are free to use whathever library
you want. Once finish, create a commit with your code changes. Zip your
modified project and send it back to the interviewer that sent you the initial
instruction. As zip files are restricted via email, name your zip archive
`list_repo_completed.zip.other` so that scan process does not reject your
email. An acknowledgment will be sent to you after reception if everything
is all right.

**Do not** send pull request on the repository.

This message will auto-destruct itself after 90 minutes.
